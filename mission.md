# HorizonView Mission

HorizonView helps you visualize missions and projects while protecting your limited attention. Each mission groups related projects, and the app encourages focusing on one or two active projects at a time to maximize completion probability.

Principles
- Attention is scarce; treat it as a fixed budget.
- Each active project consumes roughly 20% of focus.
- More than two active projects reduces success likelihood significantly.
- Prioritize ruthlessly; archive or defer non-essentials.

AI Guidance
- The AI answers prompts like “What are the projects I am working on?” by listing projects under each mission and advising on focus based on active count and progress.
- If external AI is unavailable, a local summary is generated from your data.

Behavior
- Active projects draw from the focus meter; remaining energy is 100 − 20 × active_projects.
- Drag-and-drop moves projects between missions instantly with optimistic updates.
- Archived projects stay hidden in mission columns to keep focus clear.

Recommendations
- Maintain 1–2 active projects at any given time.
- Move lower-priority items to Concept or Archived.
- When in doubt, finish one project before starting another.
